# Java CRUD Employee Management System

## Project Type
Academic Semester Project

## Overview
This project was developed during my academic semester as part of coursework
to design and implement a backend system for managing employee records using
Java and Spring Boot.

## Objective
To build a structured CRUD-based REST API following industry best practices
such as layered architecture, data persistence, and secure access.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
- MySQL
- REST APIs
- JWT Authentication
- JUnit & Mockito

## Core Features
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) employee records
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
- Secure REST APIs using JWT-based authentication
- Database persistence using MySQL
- Unit testing for services and controllers

## System Architecture
Client → REST Controller → Service Layer → Repository → MySQL Database

## My Role & Responsibilities
- Designed system architecture and database schema
- Implemented REST API endpoints
- Applied authentication and authorization concepts
- Wrote unit test cases for business logic
- Followed SDLC and Agile practices during development

## Current Status
Code is not currently available due to academic environment constraints.  
This repository contains project documentation only.  
Planned future update includes full source code implementation.

## Future Enhancements
- Role-based access control
- Pagination and filtering
- Dockerized deployment
